# About Me

Welcome to my personal website. This is a minimal, clean space where I share my thoughts, research, and projects.

I believe in the power of clear communication and thoughtful design. This site reflects those valuesâ€”focusing on content over flashy aesthetics, readability over complexity.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Research**: My academic work, publications, and ongoing investigations
- **Blog**: Thoughts on technology, academia, and life
- **Simplicity**: A clean, fast-loading site that works on any device

## Philosophy

Less is more. Good typography is invisible. Content is king.
