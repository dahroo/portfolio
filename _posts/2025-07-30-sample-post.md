# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post on this minimal Jekyll site. I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and ideas in this clean, distraction-free environment.

## Why Minimal Design?

I believe that good design should be invisible. When reading, you shouldn't be distracted by flashy animations, garish colors, or complex layouts. The focus should be entirely on the content and ideas being shared.

This site uses only **Times New Roman** typographyâ€”a classic, highly readable typeface that has served writers and readers well for decades.

## What's Coming Next

In future posts, I plan to write about:

- Research findings and methodologies
- Thoughts on technology and society  
- Book recommendations and reviews
- Academic life and productivity

## The Power of Simplicity

There's something powerful about stripping away the unnecessary. When we remove distractions, we can focus on what truly matters: the exchange of ideas, the clarity of thought, and the pleasure of good writing.
